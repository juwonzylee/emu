Harmonization automation tool available via equality graphs.
This works for simple examples for now, and there will be further work to enhance the rewrites and extractions. 

1. Clone the repository
2. Add Harmtrace binary file to your path. 
For mac users:
```(bash)
mv .stack-work/dist/x86_64-osx/Cabal-1.22.5.0/build/harmtrace/harmtrace ~/.cabal/bin
```
